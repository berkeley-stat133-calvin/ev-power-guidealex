title: Renewable Energy vs Electricity Prices in the US

This project explores the complext relationship between renewable energy usage and electricity prices 
across the United States. 
My main question I explored was: Do states that rely on renewable energy tend to have 
lower average energy prices. 

I used the Renew 2021 to 2023 datasets and a cleaned price data set to understand this 
relationship. The EV dataset which I cleaned provided vehile registrations by state.
My first step in the prokect was standardizing state names and two-letter abbreviations. 
I then combined datasets using the join() function by State. 

The Map Visualization had a hard time rendering. I had the map downloaded for a while, ended up adding 
some more code, then it went away. I have tried troubleshooting for an hour or so, and no luck. 
I will still address the trends I noticed. 

California, despite strong renewable investments, still displays hihger prices, likely due to 
large costs and managements. Fossil fuel heavy states like Texas, display low prices and moderate 
renewable energy percentages, reflecting natural gas availbility. 

While clean energy growth is essential for sustainability, the short term relationship 
found in these data sets shows a complex relationship, illustrating high infraststructure costs 
and aiming towards a stabilizing energy price.
